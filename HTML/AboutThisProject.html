    <p>
        The "Will You Go Deeper?" Project was inspired by the challenges I had faced while making this website. No it wasn't the 
        coding process which stumped me (though that wasn't easy). I was challenged by my natrual inclination for procrastination.
        I would wake up in the morning ready to work, yet an hour later I would already be on my phone watching videos about things
        I don't care a whole lot about. Before I was ready to lose all hope of ever creating a website, I realized I had the perfect
        idea for building a website in front of me. This project is as much of a joke as it is a realization of my flaw.
        I hope you enjoy its gamelike apperance and that you figure out how to avoid going deeper.
